## Work / Project Examples

### 1. LeafBank
This app was created with a team of 5 for an iOS Development course. In the class we were given the chance to build apps for real clients with regular meetings and deadlines. My team  The objective of this app was to survey and log medication usage to be used for research. My role in this project was Front-End Developer. I created the layout and user flow of the app, which came with designing both low-fi and high-fi prototypes (using Sketch and Invision). I also implemented those designs on two of the three main sections of the app.

### 2. Critix
This web application was created with a team of 4 as an image hosting application, similar to Instagram, designed for a specific kind of audience: creators who are looking for constructive criticism about their work. My role was mostly Back end but I did also assist the front end.
