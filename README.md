# CMApp

## Work / Project Examples

### 1. LeafBank
This app was created with a team of 5 for an iOS Development course. In the class we were given the chance to build apps for real clients with regular meetings and deadlines. My team was able to partner with a local development company, eXDee. exDee tasked us with developing an app that would survey and log medication usage to be used for research. 

My Role:

- Lead Front-End Developer
  - During this project I took on the challenge of creating the layout and user flow of the app, which came with designing both low-fi and high-fi prototypes (using Sketch and Invision). 
  - I also implemented those designs on two of the three main sections of the app which included:
    - Different tableViews and how they reacted to user interaction
     - The navigation bar 
      - The tab bar  

### 2. Critix
This web application was created with a team of 4 as an image hosting application, similar to Instagram, designed for a specific kind of audience: creators who are looking for constructive criticism about their work. As a rushed second attempt at a final project, given only a week to create, we are truly proud of the teamwork and end product. This project was created using Embedded JavaScript, HTML5, Materialize CSS, MongoDB + Mongoose, and Express.js

My Role:

- Back-End Developer
  - Handled User Log-in and Registration
    - Updating and authenticating users against a database using Mongoose and MongoDB
  - Implemented routing using Expressjs
- Front-End Developer
  - Created the Login and Register modal pop-ups.
  - Assisted in UI/UX design such as navigation bar layout/position, Image modal layout, and color scheme.

### 3. MatrixVision [Demo](https://steveleong.github.io/MatrixVision/)
A web application that takes the user's webcam video and manipulates the pixels to create a matrix-like filter. Originally this was a final project I did for an Art class on Net Art, done entirely in javascript, but I recently decided to convert it to a React application. In doing so I learned about the React lifecycle and how to split up a javascript project into components.

My Role:
  - I created this by myself so I was the Lead Developer.
  - Using javascript I learned how to take in a user's video and change the pixel RGB values. 
  - On top of that I figured out how to draw characters onto the canvas and animate them in such a way that they appear falling down the screen while still looking like the video image.

## Inspiration

### 1. [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)
Awwwards is one of **the** website I use when looking for inspiration. It's essentially a showcase for the top and most creative website designs. I like browsing Awwwards because it keeps me up-to-date on the cool new designs people are creating and what other designers think actually looks good. It sometimes blows my mind what people create and it makes me want to learn all these tricks and techniques.
Websites like [greeeg.com](https://greeeg.com/) and [olouen.com](http://www.olouen.com/) just make me want to become a better designer so that one day I could create something as insane.

### 2. [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)
JavaScript 30 is a challenge created by Wes Bos, a developer from Canada. He challenges you to solve a javascript problem every day for 30 days. Through doing this challenge I've remembered javascript techniques that have been glossed over in University and it has taught me new techniques I never knew! This challenge inspires me to keep learning and keep creating and after I complete it I fully intend to do my own challenge in which I create an application a day.
