# CMApp

## Work / Project Examples

### 1. LeafBank
This app was created with a team of 5 for an iOS Development course. In the class we were given the chance to build apps for real clients with regular meetings and deadlines. My team was able to partner with a local development company, eXDee. exDee tasked us with developing an app that would survey and log medication usage to be used for research. 

My Role:

- Lead Front-End Developer
  - During this project I took on the challenge of creating the layout and user flow of the app, which came with designing both low-fi and high-fi prototypes (using Sketch and Invision). 
  - I also implemented those designs on two of the three main sections of the app which included:
    - Different tableViews and how they reacted to user interaction
     - The navigation bar 
      - The tab bar  

### 2. Critix
This web application was created with a team of 4 as an image hosting application, similar to Instagram, designed for a specific kind of audience: creators who are looking for constructive criticism about their work. As a rushed second attempt at a final project, given only a week to create, we are truly proud of the teamwork and end product.

My Role:

- Back-End Developer
  - Handled User Log-in and Registration
    - Updating and authenticating users against a database using Mongoose and MongoDB
  - Implemented routing using Expressjs
- Front-End Developer
  - Created the Login and Register modal pop-ups
  - Assisted in UI/UX design such as navigation bar layout/position, Image modal layout, and color scheme.
